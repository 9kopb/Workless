When designing/developing a new application we all have our own way of doing things, using frameworks, grid systems, saved code snippets etc..., but what we usually have in common is the fact that we end up repeating lots of tasks for each project.

Workless aims to help you by offering a basic HTML5 base template filled with goodies to get you up and running on every project you do as quickly as possible.

At it's core Workless is simply a mashup of all the things I like about HTML5 Boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap with some additional stuff which I tend to use on every project such as PrettyPhoto for lightboxes, Tipsy for tooltips, Prettify for styling and colorizing code and various other bits and pieces.

Workless comes with responsive media queries setup for 'Mobile Portrait', 'Mobile Landscape', 'Tablet Portrait', 'Tablet Landscape/Small Browser' and 'Large Browser', you can demo the effect right now by simply scaling your browser window. The blue button above the logo will show what query is running.

Remember, this isn't a 'Use this, its great!', it's simply a way I found to improve my workflow and cut down on repetitive tasks in every project. Feel free to use/abuse and hack into something that fits your workflow.
